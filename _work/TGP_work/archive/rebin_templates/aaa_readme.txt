These functions and templates generate m-files that perform the rebin and integrate functions
in Herbert.

They date from around 2010 - 2012.

They are now redundant because generic multi-dimensional functions that work by reshaping the
arrays to be rebinned or integrated into a standard form and then undo the reshpaing form have
now been written.
