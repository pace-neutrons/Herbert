function alf = macro_xs_dia (obj, npath, ind, wvec)
% Path length through a 3He tube in multiples of the macroscopic absorption cross-section
%
%   >> alf = macro_xs_dia (obj, ind, wvec)
%
% The diameter is divided by the sin of the angle of the neutron path
% w.r.t. the tube axis. That is, the return argument alf is distance through
% the tube along the neutron path in multiples of the macroscopic cross-section.
%
% Input:
% ------
%   obj         IX_det_He3tube object
%   npath       Unit vectors along the neutron path in the detector coordinate
%               frame for each detector. Array size [3,n] where n is the
%               number of indices (see ind below)
%   ind         Indices of detector elements. Scalar or array
%   wvec        Wavevector of absorbed neutrons (Ang^-1). Scalar or array
%
% If both ind and wvec are arrays, they must have the same number of elements
%
% Output:
% -------
%   alf         Maximum path length along neutron direction in a 3He tube as a
%              as a multiple of the macroscopic absorption cross-section.
%               The shape of alf is whichever of ind or wvec is an array.
%               If both ind and wvec are arrays, the shape is that of wvec

% Origin of data for 3He cross-section
% -------------------------------------
% TGP took data from an approximate function for the efficieny of a tube
% due to C.K.Loong, in c. 1990.
%
%  CKL data : (Argonne)
%   "At 2200 m/s xsect=5327 barns    En=25.415 meV         "
%   "At 10 atms, rho_atomic=2.688e-4,  so sigma=1.4323 cm-1"
%
%  These data are not quite consistent, but the errors are small :
%    2200 m/s = 25.299 meV
%    5327 barns & 1.4323 cm-1 ==> 10atms ofideal gas at 272.9K
%   but at what temperature are the tubes "10 atms" ?
%
%  Shall use  1.4323 cm-1 @ 3.49416 A-1 with sigma proportional to 1/v
%
%  This corresponds to a reference energy of 25.299meV, NOT 25.415.
% This accounts for a difference of typically 1 pt in 1000 for
% energies around a few hundred meV.
