%   obj     Reconstructed object

% Backwards compatibility function. It must be able to instantiate from a
% - structure of independent class properties from the current class version
% - structure returned by the matlab intrinsic load function when reading
%   .mat files into which earlier versions of the object were saved
% - any other bespoke structures that were saved by earlier versions of the

% It is not designed to interpret the arguments passed to the current class

% Generally a class-specific function

%               are identical to the unversioned class properties with '_'
