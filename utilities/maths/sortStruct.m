function [sortedStruct index] = sortStruct(aStruct, fieldName, direction)
% [sortedStruct index] = sortStruct(aStruct, fieldName, direction)
% sortStruct returns a sorted struct array, and can also return an index vector. The
% (one-dimensional) struct array (aStruct) is sorted based on the field specified by the
% string fieldName. The field must a single number or logical, or a char array (usually a
% simple string).
%
% direction is an optional argument to specify whether the struct array should be sorted
% in ascending or descending order. By default, the array will be sorted in ascending
% order. If supplied, direction must equal 1 to sort in ascending order or -1 to sort in
% descending order.
