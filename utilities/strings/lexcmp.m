function c = lexcmp(s1,s2)
% LEXCMP  C-style array/string comparison (by lexical order)
% usage: lexcmp(s1,s2)
%
% If S1 and S2 are strings, LEXCMP(S1,S2) returns:
%    -1,  S1 < S2
%     0,  S1 = S2
%     1,  S1 > S2
% where S1 and S2 are compared by the first element that differs.
%
% S1 and S2 can be numeric or logical arrays with possibly different
% lengths and possibly containing inf/NaN values (treating pairs of NaN
% values as equal and all other values less than NaN, as per the convention
% of the built-in version of SORT).
%
% S1 and S2 can theoretically be arrays of any objects for which SIGN,
% MINUS, ISINF and ISNAN are defined, e.g. fractions (see below).
%
% If S1 and S2 are cell arrays with the same number of elements, they are
% compared element-by-element.  If one is a cell array and the other is
% not, then each element of one is compared to the other.
%
% Example:
%   lexcmp('abc','abc') %  0
%   lexcmp('abc','abd') % -1
%   lexcmp('a','ab')    % -1
%   lexcmp(nan,nan)     %  0
%   lexcmp(1:2,1:3)     % -1
%   lexcmp(fr(1,3),fr(1,2)) % -1 (using Fractions Toolbox)
%
% Implementation note:
%
% The core function could be implemented more concisely if vectorized
% rather than looped, but tests indicated that loops seem to be faster on
% average (in the original version with no inf/nan checking).  The biggest
% performance gains occur when the strings are long and differ near the
% beginning, as the loop exits early and avoids unnecessary comparisons;
% similarly when the arrays are non-numeric objects with significant
% overhead per comparison.  To get any further performance gains, the best
% option would probably be to translate the core function to MEX.

% Version history:
%   19/2/2009 - First release.  The core function is based on S.Helsen's
%     STRCMPC (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3987).
%     The find part has been replaced with a loop which is slightly faster
%     in the current version of MATLAB.
%   14/9/2009 - Updated lexcmp_core to allow infinite or NaN values
%     and added some examples to the help text.
